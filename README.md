##  Overview ##
Experiments and implementations based the Design Patterns book from 
Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides.

## Development environment ##
The implementation uses both, *STL* and *C++11* features so an 
appropriate compiler is needed.

For QTCreator it is set up as a CMake project. I've tested ist lastly 
with QtCreator 4.4.1 and GCC 6.3 on Linux.

For Visual Studio 2019 there's a solution file which is set to target 
.Net framework 4.7.
